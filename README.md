# Java Assignment

## Overview
This assignment covers fundamental Java concepts, including object creation, multiple classes, and different ways to print output. The following topics are included:

1. Printing information of 5 employees
2. Usage of `System.out.println`
3. Demonstration of `newInstance()` method
4. Simple object creation
5. Implementation of multiple classes

## Topics Covered

### 1. Print 5 Employee Information
- Create a class `Employee` with attributes like `name`, `id`, `designation`, and `salary`.
- Instantiate five `Employee` objects and print their details.

### 2. Use of `System.out.println`
- Demonstrate the use of `System.out.println` to print messages and variable values.

### 3. Using `newInstance()` Method
- Show dynamic object creation using `Class.forName("ClassName").newInstance()`.
- Handle exceptions such as `ClassNotFoundException` and `InstantiationException`.

### 4. Simple Object Creation
- Create objects of a class using the `new` keyword.
- Call methods of the created object.

### 5. Implementing Multiple Classes
- Demonstrate the use of multiple classes in Java.
- Show how different classes interact using method calls and object references.
